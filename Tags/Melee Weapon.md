Melee weapons are **close-combat weapons** that require the wielder to be in direct range of their target. They come in various shapes and sizes, from small daggers to massive greatswords, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Unlike ranged weapons, melee weapons **do not require ammunition**, making them a reliable choice for sustained combat.

### **🔍 Characteristics**

- **Range:** Limited to close combat
- **Damage Type:** Can be slashing, piercing, or blunt
- **Durability:** Some may wear down over time

- **🔱 Spears & Polearms** – Extended reach, useful for keeping enemies at bay
- **🪚 Dual-Wield Weapons** – Faster attacks at the cost of blocking ability
